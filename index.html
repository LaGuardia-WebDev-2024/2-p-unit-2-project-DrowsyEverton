        <h1 id= nat> The Natural World of Wales </h1> <br>
<p class="tree"> Wales is an English constituent country located in Europe made up of a more rugged coastline, mountainous terrian,flourishing natural landscape and culture derived from Celtic. They are part of the islands that make up the United Kingdom. <br>The land is most ideal for the more adventurous of us but dont hold me accountable for any injuries or liabilities ðŸ˜‰ ( seriously I'm not to be held accountable for any of your 'accidents' after this.)

> <p class="tree">To swiftly disact you from the idea of suing me, heres a beautiful landscape from one of our many friends in Wales.  Now look at those rounding scapes, you  can almost feel that wind blow in your face, huh? The scent of warm sharp tall grass brushing your legs...<br><br> That's right. Keep thinking that...good.</p>
<p class="tree"> Oh sorry! Lets continue to the nightlife of being in this country. I know you party animals gonna love a good bit of culture into the night! The capital of Wales is Cardiff, be holding a plethora of cultural sites to gander at in curiousity like a bumbling infant. <img src="https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F7ce48514-9246-4f59-a605-667fe4c5b143.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0"><br> <br> <p class= "tree" ></p>One of the more popular landmarks in Cardiff is the Cardiff Castle. A great location to view and peer into Wales's history. If you're a real nut for culture, this might be just the spot for you!</p> <br><br> But if you get tired of the old hustle and bustle of partying, maybe take some time to stroll in one of their many national parks. The experience could be a a breathtaker....
